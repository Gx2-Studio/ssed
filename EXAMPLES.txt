SSED EXAMPLES
=============

A comprehensive guide to using ssed (Simple sed) with practical examples.


BASIC REPLACE
-------------

Replace text in a stream or file:

    echo "hello world" | ssed "replace world with universe"
    Output: hello universe

    echo "say hello to the world" | ssed "replace 'hello' with 'goodbye'"
    Output: say goodbye to the world

    echo "hello world" | ssed "replace ' world' with ''"
    Output: hello


REGEX REPLACE
-------------

Use /pattern/ syntax for regular expressions:

    echo "order-123 and order-456" | ssed "replace /[0-9]+/ with NUM"
    Output: order-NUM and order-NUM

    echo "error: something failed" | ssed "replace /^error:/ with 'warning:'"
    Output: warning: something failed


DELETE LINES
------------

Remove lines containing a pattern:

    echo -e "error: failed\ninfo: ok\nerror: again" | ssed "delete error"
    Output: info: ok

    echo -e "# comment\ncode here\n# another" | ssed "delete lines starting with '#'"
    Output: code here

    echo -e "line one;\nline two\nline three;" | ssed "delete lines ending with ';'"
    Output: line two

    echo -e "important: keep\ndelete this\nimportant: also keep" | ssed "delete lines not containing important"
    Output:
        important: keep
        important: also keep


DELETE BY LINE NUMBER
---------------------

    echo -e "line 1\nline 2\nline 3" | ssed "delete line 2"
    Output:
        line 1
        line 3

    echo -e "line 1\nline 2\nline 3\nline 4\nline 5" | ssed "delete lines 2 to 4"
    Output:
        line 1
        line 5

    echo -e "line 1\nline 2\nline 3\nline 4" | ssed "delete first 2 lines"
    Output:
        line 3
        line 4

    echo -e "line 1\nline 2\nline 3\nline 4" | ssed "delete last 2 lines"
    Output:
        line 1
        line 2


SHOW LINES (FILTER)
-------------------

Display only lines matching a pattern:

    echo -e "error: failed\ninfo: ok\nerror: again" | ssed "show error"
    Output:
        error: failed
        error: again

    echo -e "# comment\ncode here\n# another" | ssed "show lines starting with '#'"
    Output:
        # comment
        # another

    echo -e "line one;\nline two\nline three;" | ssed "show lines ending with ';'"
    Output:
        line one;
        line three;

    echo -e "keep this\nerror here\nkeep that" | ssed "show lines not containing error"
    Output:
        keep this
        keep that


SHOW BY LINE NUMBER
-------------------

    echo -e "line 1\nline 2\nline 3" | ssed "show line 2"
    Output: line 2

    echo -e "line 1\nline 2\nline 3\nline 4\nline 5" | ssed "show lines 2 to 4"
    Output:
        line 2
        line 3
        line 4

    echo -e "line 1\nline 2\nline 3\nline 4" | ssed "show first 2 lines"
    Output:
        line 1
        line 2

    echo -e "line 1\nline 2\nline 3\nline 4" | ssed "show last 2 lines"
    Output:
        line 3
        line 4

    echo -e "first\nsecond\nthird" | ssed "show line numbers"
    Output:
             1  first
             2  second
             3  third


WHOLE WORD MATCHING
-------------------

Match complete words only (not substrings):

    Without whole word - matches "cat" in "catalog":
    echo -e "the cat sat\ncatalog here\nthe cat meows" | ssed "show cat"
    Output:
        the cat sat
        catalog here
        the cat meows

    With whole word - only matches "cat" as a word:
    echo -e "the cat sat\ncatalog here\nthe cat meows" | ssed "show lines containing whole word cat"
    Output:
        the cat sat
        the cat meows


INSERT TEXT
-----------

Add new lines before or after patterns:

    echo -e "line 1\nline 2\nline 3" | ssed "insert 'NEW' before 'line 2'"
    Output:
        line 1
        NEW
        line 2
        line 3

    echo -e "line 1\nline 2\nline 3" | ssed "insert 'NEW' after 'line 2'"
    Output:
        line 1
        line 2
        NEW
        line 3

    echo -e "line 1\nline 2" | ssed "insert 'HEADER' first"
    Output:
        HEADER
        line 1
        line 2

    echo -e "line 1\nline 2" | ssed "insert 'FOOTER' last"
    Output:
        line 1
        line 2
        FOOTER


TRANSFORM TEXT
--------------

Change case and trim whitespace:

    echo "hello world" | ssed "convert to uppercase"
    Output: HELLO WORLD

    echo "HELLO WORLD" | ssed "convert to lowercase"
    Output: hello world

    echo "hello world goodbye" | ssed "convert to titlecase"
    Output: Hello World Goodbye

    echo "   hello world   " | ssed "trim"
    Output: hello world

    echo "   hello world   " | ssed "remove leading spaces"
    Output: hello world

    echo "   hello world   " | ssed "remove trailing spaces"
    Output:    hello world


COUNT LINES
-----------

Count lines matching a pattern:

    echo -e "error here\nall good\nerror again\nfine" | ssed "count lines containing error"
    Output: 2

    echo -e "line 1\nline 2\nno number here" | ssed "count /[0-9]+/"
    Output: 2


COMPOUND OPERATIONS
-------------------

Chain multiple operations with "then":

    echo -e "# comment\nvalue=old\n# another\ndata=old" | ssed "delete lines starting with '#' then replace old with new"
    Output:
        value=new
        data=new

    echo -e "  hello world  \n  goodbye world  " | ssed "trim then convert to uppercase"
    Output:
        HELLO WORLD
        GOODBYE WORLD

    echo -e "  # COMMENT  \n  HELLO WORLD  \n  # ANOTHER  \n  GOODBYE  " | ssed "trim then delete lines starting with '#' then convert to lowercase"
    Output:
        hello world
        goodbye


WORKING WITH FILES
------------------

    ssed "replace foo with bar" input.txt

    ssed "replace foo with bar" input.txt --preview

    ssed -i "replace foo with bar" input.txt

    ssed --backup .bak "replace foo with bar" input.txt


REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES
-------------------

Log files:

    ssed "show lines starting with 'ERROR'" app.log
    ssed "delete lines containing DEBUG" app.log
    ssed "count lines containing ERROR" app.log

Configuration files:

    ssed "delete lines starting with '#'" config.txt
    ssed "replace 'debug=true' with 'debug=false'" config.txt
    ssed "delete lines starting with '#' then trim" config.txt

Data transformation:

    ssed "convert to lowercase" data.csv
    ssed "trim then delete lines starting with '#'" data.txt
    ssed "show lines 10 to 20" large_file.txt

Code cleanup:

    ssed "remove trailing spaces" code.py
    ssed "show TODO" *.py
    ssed "count TODO" *.py
